Unfinished notebooks have become a constant struggle in my creative journey. What starts of with a specific theme and motivation slowly transitions into a sea of doubts and discomfort.

I am inclined to believe that my inability to finish what was started arises from my never focused creativity. However, this past few weeks, due to circumstances beyond my control, I have come to accept my close to thirty unfinished tales and three incomplete notebooks.

Today, in the heart of the future creative hub of Tallinn I begin my new notebook and new writing challenge. Maybe this time my "re-tales" get to see the same light that makes my espresso shine.
