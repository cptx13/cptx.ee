Darkness, rippled echo and echoed ripples. 
The light comes, yet the eyes do not see.
The water ripples, and the echoes are seen.  
A sudden silent sound, and I am no longer me.  
Observing has no perspective, nothing is there to be seen.  
The ripples echo, and the echoes are now free  
The been becomes seen, and the seen is no longer me.
When the ego dies and nothing is seen, 
the darkness enlightens what was and is.  
Rippled echoes and echoed ripples 
thatâ€™s what all is meant to be.
