## Introduction

Welcome to my blog repository! This project represents my personal journey as I transition from using platforms like Wix and WordPress to creating a self-hosted blog. I have over 3,000 entries that I am in the process of uploading.

## Why I Created This Blog

After spending time on Wix and WordPress, I realized that I wanted more control over my content and the ability to customize my blog to fit my vision. This led me to explore self-hosting options, and I decided to use a static site generator to create a more flexible and efficient blogging experience.

## Resources Used

1. **Hugo**: I chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as my static site generator due to its speed and ease of use. It allows me to create and manage my blog efficiently while providing a variety of themes and customization options.

2. **Typo Theme**: I am using the [Typo theme](https://github.com/tomfran/typo) for Hugo, which offers a clean and elegant design that aligns with my vision for the blog. This theme enhances the overall user experience and makes my content more accessible.

## Inspiration

I draw inspiration from [this blog](https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/) and its creator [mrusme](https://github.com/mrusme). 

## Collaboration and Community

As I am new to this process, I understand that there may be errors or areas for improvement in my blog. I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or contributions from the community.

## Current Status

I am currently in the process of uploading my entries, which were lost during the transition from Wix to WordPress. This has been a challenging experience, but I am committed to rebuilding my content and creating a blog that reflects my journey.

## Future Goals

My ultimate goal is to have a fully self-hosted blog that I can manage independently. For now, I am using this repository as a stepping stone towards that goal-

Thank you for visiting my blog repository! I look forward to sharing my journey with you and hope to connect with fellow bloggers and developers along the way.
